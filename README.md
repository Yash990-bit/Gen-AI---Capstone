## 📖 Project Description

**GeoVal** is an intelligent real estate valuation platform that leverages machine learning to deliver accurate property price predictions for Bangalore's housing market. Built with a Random Forest Regressor trained on 13,000+ property listings, GeoVal provides instant valuations with 76% R² accuracy and a mean absolute error of ₹23.2 Lakhs.

The platform combines comprehensive data engineering (outlier removal, feature engineering, label encoding) with an intuitive Streamlit interface to serve investors, developers, and real estate advisors. GeoVal covers 240+ micro-markets across Bangalore and delivers predictions in under 5 seconds with ±10% confidence bands.

**Key Differentiators:**
- 🎯 Production-grade ML pipeline with proper train/test split validation
- 📊 Interactive price sensitivity analysis with multi-dimensional visualizations
- 🏙️ Granular location encoding for neighborhood-level precision
- 🚀 Real-time valuation with market-range estimates (low/high bounds)

## 🏗️ Architecture

![System Design](assets/system_design.png)

**Flow:**
1. **Data ingestion** from `housing.csv`
2. **EDA & feature engineering** in `EDA_and_training.ipynb`
3. **Model training** (Random Forest) with 76% R² accuracy
4. **Artifact serialization** to `models/` directory
5. **Streamlit app** (`app.py`) loads artifacts on startup
6. User inputs property details → model predicts price → results displayed with confidence bands

## 🚀 Installation

### **Prerequisites**
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager
- Virtual environment (recommended)

### **Setup Instructions**

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Yash990-bit/Gen-AI---Capstone.git
   cd Gen-AI---Capstone
   ```

2. **Create virtual environment** *(optional but recommended)*
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash

- `st.set_page_config()` — Page title, icon, layout
- Model paths in `load_artifacts()` function
- Dataset path in notebook (currently `../data/housing.csv`)

**AI Valuation:**
- Configure property details in sidebar:
  - Location (dropdown of 242+ areas)
  - Total square footage (300-10,000 sqft)
  - BHK (1-10 bedrooms)
  - Bathrooms (1-10)

### **Example API Usage** *(programmatic access)*

```python
import pickle
import numpy as np


model = pickle.load(open('models/trained_model.pkl', 'rb'))
label_encoder = pickle.load(open('models/label_encoder.pkl', 'rb'))

location = 'Whitefield'
total_sqft = 1200
bath = 2
bhk = 3

loc_encoded = label_encoder.transform([location])[0]
features = np.array([[loc_encoded, total_sqft, bath, bhk]])

prediction = model.predict(features)[0]
print(f"Predicted Price: ₹{prediction:.2f} Lakhs")
```

### **Running Tests**

No formal test suite is included. To validate the model:

1. Open `notebook/EDA_and_training.ipynb`
2. Run all cells to see:
   - Model accuracy: **76.04% R²**
   - Mean absolute error: **₹23.26 Lakhs**

## 🗺️ Roadmap

### **Planned Features**
- [ ] Add user authentication for saved valuations
- [ ] Implement historical price trend analysis
- [ ] Integrate map-based location selector (Folium/Google Maps)
- [ ] Support for comparative market analysis (CMA)
- [ ] Add PDF report generation for valuations
- [ ] Expand to other Indian metro cities (Mumbai, Delhi, Pune)
- [ ] Build REST API for external integrations
- [ ] Add model retraining pipeline with updated data

### **Known Issues**
- Location dropdown can be slow with 240+ options (consider search/autocomplete)
- Model doesn't handle locations outside training data gracefully
- No mobile optimization (layout is wide-screen focused)
- Price sensitivity chart legends can overlap with small screen sizes

### **Technical Debt**
- Refactor CSS from inline to external stylesheet (`assets/style.css`)
- Add logging for prediction errors
- Implement model versioning system
- Add data validation for user inputs
